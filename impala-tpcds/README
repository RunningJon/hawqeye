1. Create the user "impadmin" on every host.  It MUST be impadmin because Impala doesn't support passing variables to SQL scripts yet!!!
2. Create and exchange keys for impadmin for all hosts.
3. After extracting this installer, create a dn.txt file in the impala-tpcds directory with an entry for every data node where Impala is installed.
4. Edit tpcds-env.sh to set the variables you want.
4. On every datanode, create a "/datax/" directory with 1 through $DSDGEN_THREADS_PER_NODE which is set in tpcds-env.sh.  This is where data will reside and symbolic links also work.
5. On every datanode, create a sub-directory named "/datax/$TPCDS_DBNAME"

Example:

for i in $(seq 1 $DSDGEN_THREADS_PER_NODE); do
	echo "mkdir -p /data$i/$TPCDS_DBNAME"
	mkdir -p /data$i/$TPCDS_DBNAME
done

6. Create a /user/impadmin directory in hdfs
su - hdfs
hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/impadmin
hdfs dfs -chown impadmin /user/impadmin

7. You may have to edit your core-site.xml file to set the default namenode if you are using a node that isn't a data node.

Example:
vi /etc/hadoop/conf/core-site.xml
<configuration>
  <property>
    <name>fs.defaultFS</name>
    <value>hdfs://node33.gphd.local:8020</value>
  </property>
</configuration>

8. Run rollout.sh to run the entire TPC-DS bencmark.

Example:
./rollout.sh

Example to run in the background:

./rollout.sh > tpcds.log 2>&1 < tpcds.log &
