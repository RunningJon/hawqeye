1. Create a user on every host such as "impadmin".
2. Create and exchange keys for impadmin for all hosts.
3. After extracting this installer, create a dn.txt file in the home directory with an entry for every data node where Impala is installed.
4. Edit tpcds-env.sh to set the variables you want.
4. On every datanode, create a "/datax/" directory with 1 through $DSDGEN_THREADS_PER_NODE which is set in tpcds-env.sh
5. On every datanode, create a sub-directory named "/datax/$TPCDS_DBNAME"

Example:

for i in $(seq 1 $DSDGEN_THREADS_PER_NODE); do
	echo "mkdir -p /data$i/$TPCDS_DBNAME"
	mkdir -p /data$i/$TPCDS_DBNAME
done

6. Run rollout.sh to run the entire TPC-DS bencmark.
